# Porting Guide for Ansible AVD 5.x.x

Major releases of AVD can contain breaking changes. The porting guide addresses how to update your inventory
and playbooks to be compatible with new default behaviors and changed data models when upgrading from AVD 3.x versions.

Users of `eos_designs` do not have to consider the changes in `eos_cli_config_gen`, since those adaptions are
built into `eos_designs`.

## Changes to role `arista.avd.eos_designs`

### Redistribute IGMP 

Removing redistribute igmp configuration for a BGP svi/vlan belonging to a VRF with EVPN multicast.
